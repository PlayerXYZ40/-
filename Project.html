  HI guys, before we start with my real world application and how its solved, lets talk about a system of linear equations. A system of linear equation consists of 2 or more equations and the answer should always be in a coordinate that is plotable on a coordinate plane. You can solve a system of linear equation by substitution, elimination, or even graphing. Usually, the fastest method is Elimination.
</p>
<p class="N2">
  <strong>Lets Start</strong>
</p>
<p class="N1">
  Did you know that Systems of Linear Equations can be used for investing? You can solve how much was invested at each rate but for this, the information needed is how much invested, part at how much interest rate, the remarinder interest rate, and total interest from the 2 investments ofer a certain time period.
</p>

<p class="N2">
  <strong>Here is an example:</strong>
</p>
<p class="N1">
  Sam invested $8000, part at 9% interest rate, and the remainder at 10% interest rate. After one year his total interest from these two investments was $740. How much did he invest at each rate?
</p>
<p class="N1">
      There are multiple ways to solve this.
      You can use substitution, eliminaton, and graphing but I'll be showing you eliminaton and substitution.
</p>
<p class="N2">
    <strong>Problem solved by Substitution</strong>
</p>
<h6 class="W1">
  [ 1 ] x + y = 8000
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  [ 2 ] 0.09x + 0.1y = 740
</h6>
-->
<h6 class="W1">
  [ 2 ] 720 – 0.09y + 0.1y = 740
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  [ 2 ] 0.01y = 20
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  [ 2 ] y = $2000
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  [ 1 ] x = 8000 – 2000
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  [ 1 ] x = $6000
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  The answer is (6000, 2000)
</h6>
<p class="N2">
    <strong>Problem solved by Graphing</strong>

<p class="N1">
    This image shows Line B which is equation 1 and Line A which is equation 2 and as you can see, the 2 lines intercest at the point (6000,2000) which is this exact answer we would get oncce solved using either substitution or elimination and both will in the end give the same result.
</p>
<p class="N2">
  <strong>Problem solved by Elimination</strong>
</p>
<h6 class="W1">
[1] x + y = 8000
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  [2] 0.09x + 0.1y = 740
</h6>
-->
<h6 class="W1">
  [2] -10(0.09x + 0.1y = 740)
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  [1] x + y = 8000
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  [2] -0.9x - y = -7400
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  [Both] 0.1x = 600
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  [Both] x = 6000
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  0.09x + 0.1y = 740
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  y + 0 = 2000
</h6>
<h6 class="W1">
  The answer is (6000, 2000)
</h6>
